Multiscale Systems Pharmacology Model__

- Bone is constantly being remodeled, constantly turning over.  This remodeling 
process consists of breaking down old bone and building up new bone
- *Osteoclasts* are cells that function to disassemble bone (resorption) and 
*osteoblasts* are cells that function to synthesize or build new bone
- One therapeutic strategy for osteoporosis (porous bone) is to inhibit 
osteoclast activity and thus inhibit the bone resorption  activity  
- __Denosumab__ decreases osteoclast activity by preventing maturation of
pre-osteoclasts into fully-functional osteoclast cells

- The goal of the modeling was to predict nonlinear changes in lumbar spine (LS)
bone mineral density (BMD) over 48 months of denosumab treatment under
different dosing regimens. 

- __LSBMD__ was modeled as a function of bone turnover markers
- CTx: C-telopeptide, a marker for osteoclast function
- BSAP: bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, a marker for osteoblast 
function

- Our __simulation objective__ is to recreate figures 3, 4, 5, and 6 from 
the publication.  This will show the changes in CTx and BSAP and the 
subsequent changes in BMD under the model.   

## `OpenBoneMin` model

__Background and Motivation__

The model was originally developed to describe the bone marker changes 
associated with denosumab administration from a then ongoing clinical trial. 
Associated changes in serum calcium and PTH were also considered of interest 
at the time and so justified the development of a 'systems' model that included 
bone remodeling and bone mineral (calcium and phosphate) homeostatic mechanisms. 
Other therapeutics (e.g., teriparatide) and disease states (kidney failure, 
parathyroid-related abnormalities) were also considered at the time to further 
inform the parameterization and estimation of the model (Peterson and Riggs, 
Bone 2010).

__Load the model__

We will use the `OpenBoneMin` package to simulate. See below for details on 
installing this package from GitHub.


```{r}
library(OpenBoneMin)
library(tidyverse)
theme_set(theme_bw() + theme(legend.position = "top"))
```


```{r}
mod <- BoneMin()
```


## Generate the dosing regimens

__60 mg every 6 months x 8__

```{r}
month <- 24*28

regi <- function(x) factor(x, labels = c("60 mg Q6M", "14 mg Q6M", 
                                         "30 mg Q3M", "210 mg Q6M"))
xscale <- scale_x_continuous(
  breaks = c(0, 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48), 
  limits = c(0, 48)
)
```

```{r}

e1 <- ev(amt = 60, ii = 6*month, addl = 7)
e1
```

__14 mg every 6 months x4, then 60 mg every 6 months x4__
```{r}
e2 <- ev_seq(
  mutate(e1, amt = 14, addl = 3),
  mutate(e1, addl = 3)
)
e2
```

__30 mg every 3 months for 8 doses and changed to 60 mg Q6M starting 
on month 36__

```{r}
e3a <- ev(amt = 30, ii = 3*month, addl = 7)
e3b <- mutate(e1, addl = 1) %>% as.ev()
e3 <- seq(e3a, wait = 12*month, e3b)
e3
```


__210 mg every 6 months x4 then DC__
```{r}
e4 <- mutate(e1, amt = 210, addl = 3)
e4
```


__Create one single data set from which to simulate__
```{r}
data <- as_data_set(e1, e2, e3, e4)

data
```

```{r}
out <- 
  mod %>%
  mrgsim(data = data, end = 48*month, delta = 24) %>% 
  mutate(ID = regi(ID), Month = time/month)
```

## Publication figure 3: CTx vs time

Shown here is the percent change from baseline value for osteoclasts (via CTx)

```{r}
ggplot(out) + 
  geom_line(aes(x = Month, y = OCchange, col = factor(ID)), lwd = 1) + 
  facet_grid(~ID) + 
  geom_hline(yintercept = 100, lty = 2) +
  scale_y_log10(breaks = c(10,30,100,300), limits = c(5,300)) + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = c(24,36), lty = 3) + xscale
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
p <- 
  ggplot(out) + 
  geom_line(aes(x = Month, y = OCchange, col = factor(ID)), lwd = 1) + 
  geom_hline(yintercept = 100, lty = 2) +
  facet_wrap(~ID, ncol = 2) + 
  scale_y_log10(breaks = c(10,30,100,300), limits = c(5,300)) + 
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = c(24,36), lty = 3) + xscale

p <- p + labs(y = "Osteoblasts", color = "", subtitle = "Denosumab for osteoporosis")
# saveRDS(p, file = "img/README_osteo.RDS")
```


## Publication figure 4: BSAP vs time

Shown here is the percent change from baseline value for osteoblasts (via BSAP)

```{r}
ggplot(out) + 
  geom_line(aes(x = Month, y = OBchange, col = factor(ID)), lwd = 1) + 
  geom_hline(yintercept = 100, lty = 2) +
  facet_grid(~ID) + 
  scale_y_log10(breaks = c(10,30,100,300), limits = c(5,300)) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = c(24,36), lty = 3) + xscale
```

## Publication figure 5: LS BMD vs time

Shown here is the percent change from baseline value for lumbar spine BMD

```{r}
ggplot(out) + 
  geom_line(aes(x = Month, y = BMDlsDENchange, col = factor(ID)), lwd = 1) + 
   geom_vline(xintercept = c(24,36), lty = 3) +
  facet_grid(~ID) + xscale
``` 


## Publication figure 6: TGF-$\beta$ vs time

- Solid lines are __active__ TGF-$\beta$
- Dashed lines are __latent__ TGF-$\beta$

```{r}
out <- 
  out %>%
  group_by(ID) %>%
  mutate(ATGF = 100*TGFBact/first(TGFBact), LTGF = 100*TGFB/first(TGFB)) %>%
  ungroup

ggplot(out) + 
  geom_line(aes(x = Month, y = ATGF, col = factor(ID)), lwd = 1) + 
  geom_line(aes(x = Month, y = LTGF), col = "black", lty = 2, lwd = 0.6) + 
  facet_grid(~ID) + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = c(24,36), lty = 3) + xscale +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = c(0,25,50,75,100,150,225), limits = c(0,225)) 
```


# Using `OpenBoneMin`

This section goes over how to get and use `OpenBoneMin`.


## Install from GitHub as an R package

```{r,eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("metrumresearchgroup/OpenBoneMin")
```

## Load the OpenBoneMin model

```{r}
mod <- BoneMin()
```


## Teriparatide example

- Teriparatide is a recombinant parathyroid (PTH) hormone, containing only the 
first 84 amino acid residues
- Teriparatide doses are administered subcutaneously and are absorbed into
the PTH compartment; so teriparatide is considered equivalent to PTH 
- We'll give either 20 or 40 micrograms SQ daily for 10 doses
```{r}
out <- sim_teri(dose = c(20,40), dur = 9)

out
```

PTH profiles for the 20 and 40 microgram doses

```{r}
plot(out, PTHpm ~ time|ID, scales = "same")
```


Calcium profiles for the 20 and 40 microgram doses

```{r}
plot(out, CaC~time)
```


## Denosumab example
- Denosumab is a human monoclonal antibody that binds RANK ligand (RANKL), 
preventing the formation of RANK/RANKL complex and subsequent simulation 
of osteoclast maturation
- The labeled dose for treatment of osteoporosis is 60 mg SQ every 6 months

```{r}
out <- sim_denos(dose = c(14,30,60,210)) %>% filter_sims(DENCP > 1e-3)
```

Plot the denosumab concentration versus time

```{r}
plot(out, DENCP ~.,  scales = list(y = list(log = TRUE)))
```

Plot the percent change in lumbar spine BMD versus time
```{r}
plot(out, BMDlsDENchange ~ .)
```
